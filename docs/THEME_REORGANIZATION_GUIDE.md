Source theme: `/Users/matthewthompson/Documents/DEVELOPMENT/discord/betterdiscord/betterdiscord-assets/themes/SoloLeveling-ClearVision.theme.css`
Organized reference: `/Users/matthewthompson/Documents/DEVELOPMENT/discord/betterdiscord/betterdiscord-assets/themes/organized/SoloLeveling-ClearVision.organized.reference.theme.css`
Manifest: `/Users/matthewthompson/Documents/DEVELOPMENT/discord/betterdiscord/betterdiscord-assets/themes/organized/organization-manifest.json`

## Why this is safe
- No selectors were invented.
- All blocks are copied from the source theme as-is.
- Each copied block includes its original source line.
- Active runtime theme file was not replaced automatically.
